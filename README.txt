# Project-on-Airbnb-dataset

Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was trying to figure out what kinds of houses tended to have a higher price using dataset from Airbnb in Boston and Seattle.

Through the whole year, when is the average price high and when is it low?
Built a linear model with continuous variables from the dataset.
How about the influence of the categorical variables on the prices?


File Descriptions

There 1 notebook available here to show all the code and work to answer these questions. And there are 6 datasets, but the main dataset I used here is the listing dataset.


Results

The main findings are written down as a blog at
